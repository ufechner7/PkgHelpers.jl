This package makes it easy to do this. Compared to committing the Manifest.toml this approach has the following advantages:\n\nthe project stays compatible with different Julia versions;\nchanges in the git log are readable (I find the Manifest.toml file unreadable, YMMV).\n\nFreezing your package versions has one more advantage: It can avoid unwanted package updates when adding new packages to your project.","category":"section"},{"location":"#Installation","page":"Readme","title":"Installation","text":"Add it to your global environment:  \n\nusing Pkg\nPkg.add(\"PkgHelpers\") ","category":"section"},{"location":"#Usage","page":"Readme","title":"Usage","text":"Then change to the project you want to freeze or set a lower bound:\n\ncd MyProject\njulia --project\n\nand on the Julia prompt type\n\nusing PkgHelpers, Pkg\nfreeze(Pkg)\n\nor\n\nusing PkgHelpers, Pkg\nlower_bound(Pkg)\n\nThis will overwrite your current Project.toml, so make sure you committed it to git before calling this function.\n\nThe following compat entries will be added for each of your direct dependencies:\n\nfunction compat entry range specifier\nfreeze(Pkg) \"=1.2.3\" [1.2.3, 1.2.3] equality\nfreeze(Pkg; relax=true) \"~1.2.3\" [1.2.3, 1.3.0) tilde\nlower_bound(Pkg) \"1.2.3\" [1.2.3, 2.0.0) caret\nlower_bound(Pkg; relax=true) \"1.2\" [1.2.0, 2.0.0) caret\n\nIf you tested your project with the Julia versions 1.9 and 1.10, use the call\n\nfreeze(Pkg; julia=\"~1.9, ~1.10\")\n\nIf you want to set as lower bound an older Julia version, you can also do that:\n\nlower_bound(Pkg; julia=\"1.6\")\n\nOptionally you can also call the function:\n\ncopy_manifest()\n\nwhich creates a copy of the Manifest.toml file which includes the Julia version number and operating system name and add and commit this file to git.\n\nYou can also use ranges, e.g.\n\nfreeze(Pkg; julia=\"1.6 - 1.11\")\n\nIf you use a range there must be a space around the hyphen.\n\nYou can also call:\n\nfreeze(Pkg; relaxed=true)\n\nThis omits the patch version from the generated compat entry. The effect is that non-braking updates of the packages are allowed. While updates of the patch version SHOULD be non-braking, this is not always the case. Use this option with care.\n\nMore info about the version specifiers can be found here.","category":"section"},{"location":"#Keeping-your-existing-compats","page":"Readme","title":"Keeping your existing compats","text":"From version 0.3.0 onwards, there exists the keep keyword argument to both the freeze and lower_bound functions. This argument when true (the default) will keep any existing compat entries from the Project.toml. These compat values are kept exactly as is with all specifiers intact. Their order may however be affected by the call to freeze or lower_bound. Setting keep to false will result in the previous behavior of the compat section being overwritten entirely.","category":"section"}]
